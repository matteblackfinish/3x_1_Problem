# 3x_1_Problem
Testing the classic 3x+1 Mathematical Problem

Consider the following process: Pick a starting number n. If it's even, divide it by 2. If it's odd, instead multiply by 3 and add 1. Repeat over and over. If you try this out with some small starting values of n, you'll notice you eventually get stuck in the loop 4,2,1,4,2,1,...; does every starting value eventually lead to this loop?
